QuantSpace is an AI-native quantitative research framework for turning a market
idea into working strategy research without leaving the project directory.
Describe a hypothesis, universe, factor, label, rule, model, backtest constraint,
or report you want; an AI coding agent can then build on the repository's
structure to produce runnable, tested, reviewable code. The project is
compatible with mainstream AI coding tools including ChatGPT Codex, Claude Code,
Cursor, CodeBuddy, Qoder, TRAE, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Kimi Code. Compatibility
is declared in README and `AGENTS.md`; runtime collaboration uses capability
discovery rather than a product whitelist.

PandaData is the default market data provider, so real bars can be used
immediately. Data flows in through `skills.ingest`, where external symbols and
raw frames are normalized into QuantSpace conventions. Other vendors and local
datasets can plug into the same contracts, allowing the rest of the workflow to
stay unchanged.

The framework packages the full research loop as reusable skills: data
ingestion, local Parquet storage with optional DuckDB queries, factor
calculation and analysis, rule-based and machine-learning strategy development,
portfolio construction, vectorized backtesting, and performance report
management. Reusable cross-sectional/time-series strategy types and target-weight
helpers live under `strategy`; execution and portfolio construction live under
`backtest`, while model training and sparse fitting live under `ml`. `AGENTS.md` and the
per-skill `SKILL.md` files teach AI agents how to reuse these modules instead of
scattering research logic across one-off scripts.

## Architecture Overview

External bars are normalized through `ingest` into the local `store`, then reused
on demand by the capability modules, and finally distilled into reports and
reusable strategy code. The AI orchestrates the whole loop along fixed data
contracts:

## Project Layout

The repository layout is part of the product: it gives both humans and AI agents
clear places to put data access, reusable capabilities, strategy logic, scripts,
reports, and tests.

## Public Skills

Skills are the reusable building blocks that an AI agent should reach for before
writing new research code.

| Skill | Main import | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest` | `from skills.ingest import PandaDataClient, FutuClient` | PandaData/Futu ingestion, normalization, and symbol conversion |
| `store` | `from skills.store.data_manager import DataManager` | Market data, factors, backtests, model metadata |
| `compute` | `from skills.compute.indicators import trend_score` | Indicators, labels, utilities, generic factor examples |
| `strategy` | `from skills.strategy import StrategyResult` | Reusable contracts, cross-sectional/time-series types, and target-weight helpers |
| `analyze` | `from skills.analyze.factor_analysis import IC_stat` | Factor diagnostics, attribution, robustness, time-series checks |
| `backtest` | `from skills.backtest import VectorBacktester` | Vectorized execution, portfolio weighting, filters, costs, strategy blending, exit and overlay metrics |
| `ml` | `from skills.ml.ml_engine import MLEngine` | ML training/inference helpers, ML factors, and sparse LASSO fitting |
| `research` | `from skills.research import screen_all_indicators` | Factor screening and parameter sweeps |
| `report` | `from skills.report import ReportRenderer, write_research_bundle` | HTML research reports and chart helpers |
| `factor_mining` | `from skills.factor_mining import ResearchBrief, FactorSpec, FactorExecutionAdapter, ResearchController` | Versioned AI factor-mining contracts, unrestricted local Python factor generation/resolution, four ports, Research Controller, and cross-platform role task protocol |

Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` guide. There is no separate public
`construct` or `model` skill: portfolio construction belongs in `backtest`, and
model-related helpers belong in `ml`.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Python `>=3.10`
- `uv`

Install the default environment, generate a small deterministic fixture dataset,
and run the demos:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # set PANDA_DATA_USERNAME and PANDA_DATA_PASSWORD
uv sync
uv run python -m scripts.generate_sample_data
uv run python -m strategies.cross_sectional.workflows.run_demo
uv run python -m strategies.time_series.workflows.run_demo
uv run python -m pytest tests/
```

The fixture data is synthetic and deterministic, so the demos are reproducible
and safe to rerun. It is written under `data/market/`; for real research, replace
it with daily Parquet files from PandaData, Futu, or another adapter that
follows the same data model.

Optional extras:

```bash
uv sync --extra panda_data  # PandaData SDK
uv sync --extra futu        # Futu OpenAPI SDK
uv sync --extra analyze     # plotting, time-series diagnostics, parallel analysis
uv sync --extra ml          # optional PyCaret-based ML helpers
uv sync --extra query       # optional DuckDB querying
uv sync --extra report      # Jinja2 and report charts
```

## PandaData Setup

PandaData is optional at install time and becomes active once the SDK and
credentials are available:

```bash
uv sync --extra panda_data
cp .env.example .env
```

Set credentials in `.env`. `PandaDataClient` only reads `PANDA_DATA_*`
credential names:

```bash
PANDA_DATA_USERNAME=86xxxxxxxxxxx
PANDA_DATA_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Then try a small import:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.import_panda_data_demo \
  --symbol SHSE.600000 \
  --start-date 20230101 \
  --end-date 20231231
```

QuantSpace uses `EXCHANGE.CODE` symbols, such as `SHSE.510300`. PandaData-style
symbols are converted through:

```python
from skills.ingest import to_panda_data_symbol, to_quantspace_symbol

to_panda_data_symbol("SHSE.510300")  # "510300.SH"
to_quantspace_symbol("510300.SH")    # "SHSE.510300"
```

Listed ETF/LOF bars use the fund endpoints, not stock or backtest-factor
endpoints:

```python
from skills.ingest import PandaDataClient

client = PandaDataClient()
bars = client.get_fund_daily(
    "20250610",
    "20250613",
    symbol="SHSE.510300",
)
```

Use `get_fund_daily_pre` or `get_fund_daily_post` for adjusted prices and
`get_fund_etf_*` for ETF creation/redemption datasets.

## Futu Setup

The Futu skill's CLI and reference material live under
`.agents/skills/futuapi/`. QuantSpace exposes the reusable
`skills.ingest.FutuClient`, which uses the same `futu-api` SDK, normalizes
historical K-lines, and persists them through `DataManager`. Strategies and
backtests continue to read local Parquet files.

Start OpenD (version >= 10.4.6408) and install the project extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra futu
```

OpenD defaults to `127.0.0.1:11111`; override it with `FUTU_OPEND_HOST` and
`FUTU_OPEND_PORT`. Verify the full ingestion path with a small explicit universe:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.import_futu_data \
  --symbols SHSE.600519 SZSE.000001 \
  --start-date 2024-01-01 \
  --end-date 2024-12-31 \
  --ktype 1d \
  --rehab none
```

`rehab=none` writes to `data/market/1d/`; `forward` or `backward` writes to
`data/market/1d_adj/`. Historical K-lines consume quota per symbol, so the
import script performs a `get_history_kl_quota` preflight by default. For an
interactive quote check, use `.agents/skills/futuapi/scripts/quote/get_kline.py`.

## Data Model

The data model stays intentionally simple so generated strategy code can depend
on it. Market data is stored as one Parquet file per symbol:

```text
data/market/{frequency}/{symbol}.parquet
```

Each OHLCV frame is indexed by `eob` and uses:

```text
open, high, low, close, volume
```

Strategies and callers own explicit symbol lists and load them through
`read_symbols`:

```python
from skills.store.data_manager import DataManager

panel = DataManager().read_symbols(
    ["SHSE.510300", "SHSE.510500"],
    frequency="1d",
)
```

The returned panel is indexed by `(symbol, eob)`. First-level directory names
under factors, backtests, and models are caller-provided artifact namespaces,
not centrally managed instrument universes.

Set `QUANTSPACE_DATA_ROOT` when you want the same code to use a data directory
outside the repository.

## Strategy Demos

The demos show the intended shape of strategy work: `skills.strategy` owns
reusable strategy types, `strategies/` owns concrete behavior and workflows,
and `VectorBacktester` owns execution.

### Cross-Sectional Rotation

Pipeline:

```text
panel OHLCV -> generic factors -> top-percent selection -> execution -> metrics
```

Run:

```bash
uv run python -m strategies.cross_sectional.workflows.run_demo
```

This demo combines simple momentum and low-volatility factors through
`skills.strategy.cross_sectional.ModularBacktester`, using existing
`data/market/1d/` Parquet files for the demo's explicit symbol list.

### Time-Series ML

Pipeline:

```text
raw OHLCV bars -> feature engineering -> triple-barrier labels -> model -> backtest
```

Run:

```bash
uv run python -m strategies.time_series.workflows.run_demo
```

This demo uses `strategies.time_series.features.make_price_volume_features`,
`TripleBarrierLabelMaker`, a small scikit-learn classifier,
`skills.strategy.time_series.signal_to_single_asset_weights`, a date x symbol
weight matrix, and `skills.backtest.VectorBacktester` on an existing
single-symbol daily Parquet file.

### Example Strategy Reports

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.run_strategy_reports
```

This thin orchestration script reads existing PandaData daily Parquet files from
`data/market/1d/` and writes four public strategy reports plus performance PNGs
to `reports/strategy_examples/`. The cross-sectional family contains a futures
rule and a futures XGBoost ranker; the time-series family contains one rule
example and one XGBoost example. Strategy logic lives under `strategies/`;
storage, vectorized execution, portfolio weighting, ML helpers, and report
rendering live under `skills/`.

Below are the four public example performance charts produced by the script
(backtested on real historical data, **for demonstration only — not indicative of
future returns and not investment advice**):

## Documentation

Use these notes when you need the details behind the README:

- [PandaData ingest](docs/panda_data_ingest.md)

## Development

Run the public test suite before handing work back:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/
```

Before publishing, also run a release safety scan for private paths,
credentials, private strategy names, and removed research-only modules.
Generated data and private research reports should stay local; the sanitized
public examples under `reports/strategy_examples/` are the intended report
artifacts in the open repository.

## Data Sources and Assumptions

- The default data source is PandaData; other vendors or local datasets can be
  used as long as they follow the same data contracts.
- The bundled fixture data is synthetic OHLCV, used only for demos and
  reproducible tests, and does not represent real market data.
- The framework ships no profit-validated strategies; everything under
  `strategies/` and `reports/strategy_examples/` is illustrative.

## Limitations and Risk Boundaries

- QuantSpace is a research and engineering framework, not an automated trading
  system; it connects to no broker and places no orders.
- Factor, strategy, backtest, and report outputs are research materials only,
  constrained by the data window, parameter choices, and sample range.
- Whether to use any output in real trading must be decided independently by the
  user, together with their own strategy, risk controls, and execution process.

## Disclaimer

This repository is only a packaging of quantitative research methodology and an
engineering framework. It validates no return claims and does not constitute
investment advice. Do not use the framework or its example outputs directly as a
basis for investment decisions.
